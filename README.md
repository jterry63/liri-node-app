# Liri Node App

Liri is a node app that is built to retrieve data from Twitter, Spotify, and OMBD. If called on, Liri will get tweets from any specified user, retrieve requested song information from Spotify, and movie data from OMBD. 

## Getting Started

This app requires unique keys for each API and those are stored in the .env file. This will need to be created and stored in .gitignore for privacy. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
npm install twitter

npm install inquirer

```
