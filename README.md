# Liri Node App

Liri is a node app that is built to retrieve data from Twitter, Spotify, and OMBD. If called on, Liri will use inquirer to prompt the user to get tweets from any specified Twitter username, retrieve requested song information from Spotify, and movie data from OMBD. 

## Getting Started

This app requires unique keys for each API and those are stored in the .env file. This will need to be created and stored in .gitignore for privacy. 

### Prerequisites

```
npm install twitter
npm install --save node-spotify-api
npm install dotenv
npm install inquirer
```
